# Format Date Advanced

## 🎮 About the Project
A JavaScript function `formatDate` that allows you to transform a given `date` string from one format to another. The function accepts the old format (`fromFormat`) and the new desired format (`toFormat`) as arrays, and returns the date in the new format. This provides flexibility in handling various date format conversions.
